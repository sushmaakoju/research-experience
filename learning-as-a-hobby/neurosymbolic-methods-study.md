## Learning as a hobby: Neurosymbolic Methods in AI

I am Sushma Anand Akoju (she/her/hers). This page documents my ongoing educational journey outside formal degree programs. I've created this resource to provide transparency about my learning path while maintaining professional boundaries. My gratitude to all longterm mentors and shortterm mentors whenever I received support. I did not consistently receive mentorship, but it was some occassions when my mentors recognized I was interested to study.

#### Purpose of this page 

***********************
**_This Purpose statement only refined with assistance from Anthropic's Claude AI._**

This compilation serves as a record of my self-directed learning and is shared with the following principles:
- To provide context for my academic and research background.
- To document the progression of my interests and expertise.
- Not intended for competitive purposes or professional promotion or intellectual domination or self-sustainability.
- Reflects voluntary learning outside of funded research projects.

*********************

### Note on Course Selection and Academic Context

The courses listed in these sections reflect areas of study that were not part of standard or available course listings when I began my PhD in August 2022. As a result, I pursued many of these topics independently outside of formal university offerings, often without consistent access to subject matter experts in these specific domains. For this purpose, I have separated skills and learning that are not part of formal course offerings. This distinction is maintained to safeguard against biased or presumptive evaluations of my skills, and to ensure that any formal assessment is conducted through a professional, respectful, and fact-based conversation. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/skills-learnt-no-enrollment"> skills-learnt-without-enrollment </a>

### Note about criticisms
While pursuing my research independently, I have encountered various forms of feedback and critique - some constructive, others less so. I maintain selective engagement with criticism based on several factors rooted in professional experience and personal boundaries.

I recognize that interdisciplinary expertise spanning multiple domains may not always be immediately understood or appreciated. Recognition of innovative work often requires time. I encourage those who value scholarly diversity to support researchers with unique skill sets, as such individuals may face disproportionate challenges in traditional academic environments.
