## Learning as a Hobby: Courses, Workshops, Tutorials & Status

Sushma Anand Akoju, she/her/hers, May 2025

This page documents my ongoing educational journey outside formal degree programs. I've created this resource to provide transparency about my learning path while maintaining professional boundaries.

#### Purpose of this page 

***********************
**_This following Purpose statement refined with assistance from Anthropic's Claude AI._**

This compilation serves as a record of my self-directed learning and is shared with the following principles:
- To provide context for my academic and research background
- To document the progression of my interests and expertise
- Not intended for competitive purposes or professional promotion
- Reflects voluntary learning outside of funded research projects

*********************
