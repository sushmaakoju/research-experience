## Cinematography Speed Analysis: Shiva Cycle Chase Sequence

### Project Overview

I conducted a technical analysis of the cycle chase sequence from the Telugu film *Shiva* using computer vision techniques. This project demonstrates the application of optical flow algorithms to analyze cinematographic motion and quantify camera/subject speeds in classic cinema.

### Technical Approach

- **Tool** : OpenCV flow-matching algorithms
- **Sequence Analyzed**: Cycle chase scene (~3.3 minutes)
- **Method**: Optical flow analysis to estimate relative speeds between frames
- **Analyzed Sequence:** <a href="https://youtu.be/xdGyBDVLjAQ">Watch on YouTube (3:32)</a>

### Key Findings

**Speed Range**: 35-96 km/h across the sequence esp. the frames containing the cycle and closeup frames.

The analysis reveals significant speed variation, showcasing the pioneering steadicam work and dynamic cinematography that made this sequence iconic. The speed variations correspond to different shot compositions and storytelling beats within the chase.

### Technical Innovation in Context

This sequence is notable for its groundbreaking use of:
- Steadicam techniques in Indian cinema 
- Dynamic camera movement synchronized with subject motion
- Innovative cinematographic storytelling

This analysis demonstrates how computational tools can quantify the technical achievements of classic cinema, providing objective metrics for what was intuitively understood as groundbreaking filmmaking.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Flow-matching algorithms for motion estimation
- Video frame analysis

### Significance

This project illustrates the intersection of computer vision, cinematography, and film history. By applying modern computational analysis to classic cinema, we can better understand and document the technical innovations that shaped filmmaking.
