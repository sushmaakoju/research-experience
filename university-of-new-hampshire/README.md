- Created resources for analyzing logical fallacies, paradoxes, and misinformation detection.
- Project materials: [First Order Logic as a Practical Tool](https://tinyurl.com/fol-as-a-tool).
- All content independently authored and prepared without external review by me.

**Final Project presentation: Natural Language Understanding Research, Spring 2025, CS Poster presentation**
- Developed comprehensive NLP/NLU research project outside of scope of Robotics specialization requirements, outside of Course requirements as course is more robotics focussed.
- Independent research initiative launched January 2025.
- Complete LaTeX documentation prepared and currently under NLU/NLP experts review.
- Project demonstrates integration of advanced coursework with specialized research interests, which fall outside of robotics, due to extensive robotics focussed instruction of the course.
