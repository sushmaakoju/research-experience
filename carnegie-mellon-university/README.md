## Volunteer work

- I donated to a lot of organizations - Feeding America, Tartan, International Rescue Committee and International Food bank and many more in the USA.

### Machine Learning Department & Human-Computer Interaction Institute Mar 2016 - Mar 2019

I worked on Conversational AI, several Machine Learning and AI concepts during Yahoo InMind project under the supervision of Prof. Tom Mitchell and Prof. Justine Cassell. My work was mainly to write code and help the researchers for building the applications for InMind project.

- Natural Language Generation
- User Intent Recogntion
- Audio features extraction using OpenSmile (software, without learning)
- Eye and Head nod detection using OpenFace (software, without learning)
- Unity 3D integration in Android Java
- Integarting various Middleware components designed by Researchers

#### Note 
During my work at Carnegie Mellon University, my first ever assignment was towards working on Conversational AI in March 2016. At that time I had no background in ConversationalAI, it was also soon after I graduated from University of Pittsburgh. And I was only given software programming code in C++, C\#, Java, javascript and Android Java. I was recruited as an Android Research programmer, but I was glad to be flexible enough to work on multiple programming languages as needed with some guidance from experts. That was my first-hand experience of learning about conversational AI and by looking at the software code as a language to learn the concepts. During this first assignment, I modified some parts of the software code to extract facial features (movement) from live video streams, using OpenFace modules and extract audio features such as fundamental frequency, etc from audio streams using OpenSmile. **It was during this work, I completed my first course on Neural Networks.** I have worked on and modified software programs in C\# for Unity3D modeling of the Socially-aware animated intelligent personal assistant. I also worked on integrating modules to Android programs and various other rule-based event frameworks. Bug fixing, integration of modules written by others into Android framework was an important part of work. Main goal was to help researchers with proof-of-concept software modules.

### Computational Biology Department Mar 2019 - Jan 2020

Worked part of HubMAP project for prototype demonstration. Worked on Imaging Mass Spectrometry analysis combined with Segmentation over Microscopy Imaging data for (MALDI), metabolites and images datasets.

### Robotics Nov 2020 - Jul 2021

I worked on Computer Graphics project over vehicle satellite images dataset.

- <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/mturk-task-helper">Conducted Mechanical Turk Annotations tasks for Object Classification and Object Identification</a>

- <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/yolo"> Object Detection using MTurk annotated dataset and other manually labelled Ground Truth Images dataset using YOLO.</a>

### Machine Learning Department Feb 2020 - Oct 2020

I worked on developing a regression analysis over lab experiments under supervision of Prof. Barnabas Poczos and Prof. Newell R. Washburn. This project uses custom algorithms broadly under the topic of Hierarchical Machine Learning using uncertainity predictions. (is under confidentiality agreement). Developed a website that has electron user interface which can be hosted as a website as well as an desktop application and can take an input excel sheet with data and custom domain specific "theory" at various layers in the "hierarchy".

- I took up an interesting challenge to write a parser for polynomial equations, which was very interesting to me: <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/polynomial-equation-parser"> Polynomial Equations Parser</a>

## Courses Enrolled while working as an Research programmer at CMU

 - Advanced Intro to Machine Learning <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~10715-f18/">CMU-10715, 2018, Prof. Nina Balcan.</a>

 - Required for InMind project, on invite - Seminar course in Never Ending Learning Architectures (2018), Prof. Tom Mitchell.

 - Probability and Mathematical Statistics<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/spring19.shtml"> 36-700, 2019, Prof. Valérie Ventura.</a>

### Course project for 10812, Architectures in Never Ending Learning, Spring 2018, Prof. Tom Mitchell and Abulhair Saparov

10812 Project: There was a simulation of an agent using reinforcement learning provided as starting point - that adapts Jelly Bean World work created by NELL team. 
I worked on a implementing a basic framework using first order logic and grounded predicates based on facts in a
knowledge base, to study the agent’s behaviour. The agent could perform tasks by using optimization
techniques, so the agent learns from traditional task based learning. 
I have been mentored by the TA, Abulhair Saparov, 10812 course on following topics: 
   - automated theorem proving [link], 
   - sequent calculus, natural deduction and 
   - first-order logic with Horn clauses.

Prior to this learning experience, I had interest in First Order Logic as a hobby and <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/tree/main/study-on-logic"> provides more information of the background.</a> I have respect for the teachers and chances to learn. But I did not get a chance to work with the teachers after 2020 on First Order Logic.
