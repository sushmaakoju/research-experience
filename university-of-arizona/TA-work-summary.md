## Teaching Assistant, CSC 473 Automata, Grammars and Languages, Aug 2023 - May 2023.

Sushma Anand Akoju, she/her/hers, May 2025

I worked as Teaching Assistant for CSC 473 Automata, Grammars and Languages taught by and under supervision of Prof. Cesim Erten.

Assigned Responsibilities were :

- To conduct Office Hours
- Grading homework assignments
- Responding to the questions on the Piazza
- Attending weekly TA meetings
- Generating homework solution key
- Posting assignment solutions within 1 week after submission deadline
- Detecting plagiarism/cheating in assignments
- Designing the rubric

### Self-volunteered responsibilities outside of assigned TA responsibilities:

- Extending Office hours beyond 3 hour limit.

- Adjusting homework solution generation task promptly.

- Understanding, answering to questions on the Piazza, with multiple approaches and providing example solutions.

- Revising lecture materials, reading more textbooks, research papers on the subject.

- Creating answer key with different solutions to 98% homework assignment solutions.

- Selecting an agreed homework solution by taking approval for each homework assignment solution
- Recommending various ways to explain homework assignment solutions based on weekly TA Office hours and questions on piazza.

- Suggesting other TAs that knowing homework solutions prior to conducting office hours is not mandatory to conduct Office hour. This is because we are not allowed to give solutions to students to homework assignments but enable students with comprehension, help with some hints and make it easier to solve homework assignment problems without revealing solutions.

- Dealing with challenging experiences without impacting any deadlines and the quality.

- As a Teaching Assistant, I had regular duties like any other student TAs. I think being a TA is chance to continuously learn and be open to new questions and challenging own comprehension. Not limiting to any point of view.

- A key observation as reported by many students during Teaching Assistant Office Hours from Fall 2023, was students felt homeworks were long and difficult if they never came to Office hours of either the professor or the Teaching Assistant. I had conducted couple of hours longer Office hours during Fall 2023 to help students voluntarily. Based on feedback, homework assignments' design was modified for Spring 2024 by the professor and together with the professor, we changed the format of the homework assignments for this course to separate Undergrad and Grad students.

- I have prior experience working as a Teaching Assistant at University of Colorado Boulder on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence courses.

- My motto - Theory subjects are fun and interesting and they do go alongside Application-oriented works.

- Both learning a subject and teaching are a never-ending learning.

- I previously studied this subject out of interest in languages and theory.

### Completed courses/certifications

- Completed: Learning Assistant certification.
- Completed: IA  699 - Teaching Writing in All Disciplines
- Spring 2024: IA 699 - Teaching as a Research
- Teaching: <a href="https://academicaffairs.arizona.edu/about-cirtl">CIRTL</a> Practitioner Level II Spring 2024
- Teaching: <a href="https://academicaffairs.arizona.edu/about-cirtl">CIRTL</a> Associate Level I Fall 2023 - Spring 2024
- My Teaching as a Research project/case study <a href="https://sites.google.com/arizona.edu/uofatarprojects/spring-2024/sushma-akoju?authuser=0">Impact of Supplemental Instruction Sessions on the stress levels & amount of time spent on homework assignments by the students, in an era of Internet solutions and advanced AI tools: A case study.</a>

### Strengths

- To explain a complex subtopic/concept in way that it is understood while also making it interesting and allowing room for more conversation/questions.

- To not compromise on quality due to deadlines. 

- To be open to learn more, since fun of learning, expanding skills, understanding and answering unfamiliar questions cannot be aligned with monetary expectations.


### üèÜAchievements as a Teaching Assistant

- Students found I was approachable to seek academic help and ask questions to better understand the concepts. Students connected with me to ask questions about the lecture materials and course topics.

- Suggestions/ideas that I proposed in Fall 2023, were implemented in Spring 2024: 
    - I proposed ideas to conduct syllabus-driven Supplemental Instruction sessions for practice, add quizzes in-class, ideas to accommodate points for the questions and answers from the students in October 2023.

- I responded to Piazza questions constantly during both semesters (fall 2023, Spring 2024) and interacted with lot of students whenever they had questions and I received appreciation for comprehension and helping students as well as being open to receiving feedback from students as a Teaching Assistant. Please do contact me for more details.

- I studied the stress among students for this course if the students take advantage of opportunities provided to help them and if that really helps/helped them to reduce stress and improve scores. So I work on this as part of **Teaching as a Research (TAR) course** is part of CIRTL, taught by Instructors Kristin Winet and Byron Richard Hempel and I am grateful for amazing instructors.

- **During Fall 2023**, it became a Spiritual quest for me. So at one point there was a question on Left Quotient problem. I quickly found a research paper on this and I had the answer. So I read about Transducers before, so it was easier to connect about Transducers that have an input and output. So I used Transducers to come up with a transducer-type of solution to **visually explain to the students** although it might have different description for a different types of automata.

- Implementing these ideas is a lot of hard work and I am truly grateful for working with Prof. Cesim Erten.

### My contributions to this course as a Teaching Assistant during Fall 2023:

So I read about Transducers before, so it was easier to connect about Transducers that have an input and output. So I used Transducers to to come up with a transducer-type of solution to **visually explain to the students**.
 
- Being ready to listen to any type of questions and to help with answers or to seek and/or learn better answers.
 
- I proactively suggested to reduce heavy weight on homeworks, and suggested to have quizzes and having points/extra credits for piazza questions in Fall 2023 which was part of my Teaching Assistant evaluation form filled on Oct 8th-9th 2023.
 
- **During Fall 2023**, I proactively proposed the idea of **Supplemental Instruction sessions** at the begining of the Fall semester 2023 (which are also the recitations/practice sessions about lectures), as per discussions with Professor.

### My contributions to this course as a Teaching Assistant during Spring 2023:

- **During Spring 2023**, I assimilated specific methods and examples, to make subject easier and better. I cannot reveal more details about how, what etc since it is within purview of subject and confidentiality per policies.

- **During Spring 2023,** I worked on exploring ways to help students in reducing stress levels among the students, making this subject fun and simpler. So I requested to extend Supplemental Instruction sessions to Spring Semester as well. I learnt from professor to explain in more simpler terms each time.

- My main goal is that Theory is fun so I thought others can also benefit looking at the fun side. 

- I worked on **Teaching as a Research course** project where I conducted a case study to understand the impacts of the Supplemental Instruction session on the stress-levels and amount of time spent on homework assignments of the students, under minimally guided environment, at University of Arizona. **Teaching as a Research (TAR) course** is part of CIRTL, University of Arizona taught by Kristin Winet and Byron Richard Hempel. Prof. Cesim Erten is also part of this project. I am truly grateful from **TAR** instructors Kristin, Byron and Professor for CSC 473 course: Prof. Cesim Erten.
