### Proactive measures
- Due to previous experiences with authorship concerns, potential plagiarism/copyright threats, hazing, and coercive behavior, I implemented additional protective measures before sharing all of my projects on Github. I proactively recorded each feedback received, of which only a couple of comments that were relevant to Natural Language Understanding/Neurosymbolic methods and my study focus were implemented.
- No consent given to anyone to share with others or make false claims. I worked with my attorney to have an exhaustive documentation and verification to safeguard myself from any such potential threats.
- If anyone making false claims/false complaints of authorship for my works, they are getting themselves in legal trouble due to forensically verified authorship.

## Masters in Data Science:

### Volunteer work as an experienced student:

- I used to volunteer to explain any concepts to the students for Statistics, Data Mining, and Data Science classes.
- I used to take active part in organizing group study preparations for exams.
- I also did group project couple of times.
- I also volunteered and used Image processing tools for finetuning over handwriting dataset for handwriting recognition and extracting text from attendance sheet as a Teaching Assistant. In a modern day classroom, Teaching Assistant work requires us to monitor attendance, but to have a student sign an attendance sheet on paper ensures attendance is recorded. Such paper attendance records are not invasive but also retain the integrity of attendance without proxy. handwriting recognition can also be used to detect changes in handwritten patterns for same entries, to recognize potential classroom proxies etc. This is not to scare students or anyone, just to record the results closer to ground truth such as headcounts ete. Such methods help to measure the factors impacted from Covid related transitions such as in-person to online lectures and so on.

### Main focus of my study which I explored as part of this Masters program

I explored various forms of explainability and interpretability towards complex, black-box-style Deep Learning models. I explored trying to address the same using logic and various following directions. **The following works were as a volunteer and do not belong to any specific funded research project.**

1. First by <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-Interpretability_explainability.pdf">comparing traditional statistical methods and their simplicity, explainability with that of unexplainable deep learning models</a>.
2. Second by exploring <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-KRR%20Project%20Final%20Presentation.pdf">StrategyQA, EntailmentBank from Allen AI Institute's datasets and research papers, then by studying Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and Logical Neural Networks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-mln-stats-fall-2021-final.pdf">Markov Logical Networks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-Theorem%20Prover.pdf">Automated Theorem prover</a>.
3. Third, by understanding state-of-the-art Natural Language research towards Logic and Reasoning.
4. Fourth, by <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-Analyzing_tools_for_Visualizing_Deep_learning_Models_for_Natural_Language_text___info_viz_project_report.pdf">exploring visual explainability of Deep Learning models for Natural Language text</a>.
5. Also explored philosophical and ethical requirements for industry-driven tasks using Deep Learning models and AI. There are pros and cons to the Ethics in Data Science course, CU Boulder (final course project reports not included here).
6. Need for generalization and abstractions versus domain-specific, task-oriented AI pipelines in Data Science and Data Analysis such as <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/nlp-bio-bert">Biomedical text corpus during NLP course</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-task4-final-project-assignment.pdf">SemEval Task 4 Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection (PCL) - ranked 1 in first round</a>.

## 8. Independent Study, Prof. Henry Lovejoy : Study and design of NER & Text extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes

I worked on an Independent Study supervised by Prof. Henry Lovejoy for the Digital Slavery Research Lab, at the University of Colorado, Boulder. It was towards the study and design of Named Entity Recognition from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes and to train a search over OCR scanned documents. The goal was to analyze and emancipate people from the present impressions of the past: <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/dsrl/collaborators"></a>.

### Code repository for this project
<a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/named-entity-text-extraction-ocr-slave-trade-volumes">Independent Study:  Study and design of NER & Text extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes (British Parliamentary Papers) </a>

### Summary Reports of the study and approach for the Independent Study

- <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-independent-study-digital-slavery-first_summary_report.pdf"> First report: study and design of Named Entity Extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes and to train a search over OCR scanned documents<a/>

- <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/university-of-colorado-boulder/sushma-akoju-digital-slavery-project-indep_study_final_report.pdf"> Second report: study and design of Named Entity Extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes and to train a search over OCR scanned documents<a/>

- The challenge here was that Named Entity Recognition needs to run over the text extracted from the 19th-century English language text corpus. Performance over BERT under zero-shot settings was poor for 80% of the vocabulary. So we used <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/macberth-eval">MacBERTh</a> model.

## Teaching Assistant for MSBC 5180 Machine Learning in Python and MSBC 5190 Artificial Intelligence

I worked on developing a course curriculum with the course instructor for MSBC 5190 Artificial Intelligence which begins with Neural Networks, introduces CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs, Transformers, etc. I also implemented homework assignments that which professor updated and shared. I also shared templates for creating homework assignments on some datasets for basic Linear regressions, Multilayer perceptron, Generalized linear models, etc. I also was a teaching assistant for a Machine Learning course that begins from the topics of Linear regression, logistic regression, gradient descent optimization, multilayer perceptron, basic neural networks model for linear regression, etc which was also programming and theory intensive. Both of these classes contained 70+ students and one Teaching Assistant. I was glad to stretch myself and learn not only from re-learning concepts of neural networks but also to learn from challenging questions from students. As a Teaching Assistant, I got a chance to learn more and expand my skills towards stronger foundational knowledge in Machine Learning and Neural Networks models.

#### MSBC 5180 Machine Learning in Python, Fall 2021

Helped students with Python programming and concept-to-implementation related questions and evaluated homework and conducted recitations on Support Vector Machines for hard vs Soft margins, Gradient Descent
& Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms, Logistic Regression, sklearn packages, Perceptrons & Multilayer
Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZxJXWJBVtpwqMg95O9e1YJgu7eVjCdnW?usp=sharing">Recitations</a>.

#### MSBC 5190 Artificial Intelligence & Neural Networks, Spring 2022

- Helped create course content (topic selection, materials, discussion, and brainstorming), helped students towards programming and concept-to-implementation related questions, evaluated homework, conducted recitations on Word2vec, GloVE vectors, Pre-processing text corpus, Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short term memory networks. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o9eVgXfnxo1EduW0pxKjVBq21I3Fe77E?usp=sharing">Recitations</a>.

- I also volunteered and used Image processing tools for finetuning over handwriting dataset for handwriting recognition and extracting text from attendance sheet as a Teaching Assistant. In a modern day classroom, Teaching Assistant work requires us to monitor attendance, but to have a student sign an attendance sheet on paper ensures attendance is recorded.

## Student Proctor, Student Testing Center, University of Colorado Boulder, Mar - Jul 2022
Proctored exams for Student Testing Center. Helped to create process guidelines and reminders during finals weeks.

## Student Assistant, July 2022 - August 2022, Dr. Jane Wall and Kaitlyn Rye

Worked on reviewing and editing changes to quizzes and course content for Coursera Specialization for
Pathways. 
- I mentored two team members.
- I studies research methods on learning methodologies in online learning platforms and the survey of engagement and successful completion of students.
- I incorporated the analysis from the research studies into developing a data analysis in R programming.
- Adding to this, I worked on this project for merely 1 month, we also received good reception for the research analysis we presented not only from the group I was working with but also from the conference this work was specifically presented.
